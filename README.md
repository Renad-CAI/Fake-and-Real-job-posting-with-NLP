# Job Posting Fraud Detection Project

## Overview

The Job Posting Fraud Detection Project is an innovative endeavor that combines Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to classify job postings into fraudulent or legitimate categories. This project is designed to enhance the precision and effectiveness of fraud detection within the job market, contributing to a more secure and reliable job application process.

## Project Goal

The primary objective of this project is to advance the field of NLP-based fraud detection within the job market. By employing NLP techniques and machine learning models, we aim to build a robust and precise algorithm that automates the identification of fraudulent job listings. This project not only enhances the accuracy of job application processes but also contributes to a more secure and reliable job market for all stakeholders.

## Key Components:

### Data Preprocessing
- **Text Tokenization**: The project begins with text tokenization, breaking down job postings into individual words and phrases to facilitate analysis.
- **Stopword Removal**: Common stopwords are removed to clean and standardize textual data for more meaningful analysis.
- **Lemmatization**: Lemmatization is employed to reduce words to their base or dictionary form, improving the consistency of the text.

### Machine Learning
- **Algorithms**: Various machine learning algorithms are applied to examine job descriptions, locations, company profiles, and other textual attributes. This diversity of algorithms ensures a comprehensive analysis.
- **Predictive Modeling**: By using machine learning models, a predictive system is developed to categorize job listings as either fraudulent or legitimate, based on the analyzed content.

### Linguistic Analysis
- **Word Frequency Analysis**: The project delves into frequently occurring words in both real and fake job descriptions. This analysis provides valuable insights into linguistic patterns associated with each category, aiding in fraud detection.
